(Just to be clear, I am not the author of these scripts, but I compiled them from other authors' work and tools. No, I am not stealing them, please do not confuse that. Please understand that I am simply compiling a folder of scripts from various authors. Unfortunately, I do not remember who they were, so I cannot credit their GitHub or anything else. I apologize, but I am not violating any copyright rules or any others.)
